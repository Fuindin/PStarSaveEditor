# PStarSaveEditor

A windows forms application that allows the user to load and edit save states for the Genesis / Mega Drive games: Phantasy Star 2, Phantasy Star 3, and Phantasy Star 4.

This project was written in C# using Visual Studio 2012. The program currently works with save states for Phantasy Star 2, 3, and 4 that were generated from the Fusion364 emulator (.gs0, .gsx files). *Make sure to create a backup of your save state file before editing just in case something doesn't go quite right.

I created this project after wanting to play through Phantasy Star 3 without having to "grind". I have always been a fan of the Phantasy Star series of games. I played through Phantasy Star 3 after renting it at a local video game rental store / arcade when the game was first released. I bought the game not long after and have played through it many times. Recently I got the itch to play through it again, but I didn't want to have to grind for money or experience. So I decided to play it on an emaulator and look for programs or tools that would allow me to edit the gold and experience to help move the game along. After searching for a few hours I couldn't find anything that worked in Windows 8 / 10 or worked at all. I then decided to make my own.

I started the edtior for Phantasy Star 3 and got it working correctly. Then I decided to add support for Phantasy Star 2 and Phantasy Star 4 as well. I haven't added support for editing items, techs, or skills, but you can edit meseta (the game currency), experience, and most of the characters stats.

It has been a lot of fun working on this project and I hope it helps other people go back and play these games again.
